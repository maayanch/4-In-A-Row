=  Description:  =
In this exercise we built the game four in a row.

The game four in a row contains a board with disks so there are two different
disks one of PLAYER ONE and second of PLAYER TWO. At each stage in the game
each player in turn put his disc on the board. The disks are filled from the
bottom of the board to the top of the column that the user selects.
The aim of each player's game is to be the first to make 4 discs in a row from
his disks (row, column or diagonally). If the board is filled and no one wins
(there are no 4 discs in a row or column or diagonally of any of the players)
then there is a draw.

In this exercise the game is built to be played on two different computers
connected to the same network, when the player starts is the PLAYER ONE on
the first computer and the second to play is PLAYER TWO from the second
computer.
There are 3 options: play a person against another person, play a person
against the computer (AI) or the computer will play against a computer
(AI against AI). In each option, one of the parties may be the player who
starts the game and vice versa.

In this exercise we used OOP programming, by building files and different
departments that are responsible for parts of running the game. Some of the
files and classes we used included using the GUI (game design and graphics),
updating the game's graphical interface, using communication and connecting
different computers on the same network, including the differentiation between
the first computer player's turn and the second computer player's turn,
and updating the moves of the other player to the game board on the computer
of the first player(and the vice versa) and when one of the players is a
computer Random the move of the computer and updating of the boards.

This exercise contains the following files that run together the game:
four_in_a_row.py- This file is the main file that responsible to run the game
and connect between all the other classes the file have various function that
response to clicking on the game board in the requested column of the player
and sending to the relevant functions to make the move and in the case of AI
perform the action when the turn of the player arrives
ai.py- this file containing class that responsible to play the moves of the
computer (AI).
game.py- The file is responsible for the game moves. The algorithms and
functions in the file perform the actions of the players, identify whether
there is a winner, and make sure that the actions that the players perform
in accordance with the rules of the game. all the over files updating what
going in the game in each turn by functions from this file.
gui.py-this file contains the class GuiBoard that responsible to  show
the graphics of the game to the user (on the game board). and send and process
a massage from other users. the function in this file updating the graphic game
board in each turn in the game and prompt for winner or draw when the game is
over.(also prompt for illegal move if one of the players try to put a disk at
full column)

the game also using the communicator.py file that given with the exercise for
the connection.
